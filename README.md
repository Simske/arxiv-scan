1. Set up keywords and relevant authors: 
    a) Run 'python wordcounter.py'. It will ask for an ASCII file and extract words with 4-12 characters from it, sorted by occurrence in the file.
    b) You will be asked to rank these suggested keywords. For each word shown, press 'Enter' to reject it or provide a rating from 1 to 5 (higher=more relevant). Conclude by pressing 'C'.
    c) Manually insert particularly important authors and their ratings in 'authors.txt'.

2. Query today's astro-ph listing for relevant papers:
